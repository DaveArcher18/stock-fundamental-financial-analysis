## 7. Sensitivity Analysis

### Value Driver Ranking (Tornado)

Which parameters have the biggest impact on intrinsic value?

| Rank | Parameter | Range | Low | High | Swing |
|-----:|-----------|------:|----:|-----:|------:|
| 1 | growth_rate | 3% → 18% | €51 | €182 | €131 |
| 2 | operating_margin | 28% → 42% | €194 | €322 | €128 |
| 3 | capex_to_revenue | 4% → 10% | €182 | €112 | €70 |

| 6 | terminal_growth | 2% → 4% | €59 | €69 | €9 |
| 7 | nwc_to_revenue | 10% → 20% | €54 | €48 | €7 |

**Key insight:** Revenue growth is by far the most impactful parameter, with a swing of **€131** between bear and bull cases. WACC ranks second, followed by operating margins.

### WACC × Terminal Growth (Value / Share)

| WACC \ g∞ | 1.5% | 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% | 3.5% |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 7.0% | €100 | €107 | €115 | €126 | €139 |
| 7.5% | €91 | €97 | €103 | €111 | €121 |
| 8.0% | €84 | €88 | €93 | €100 | €107 |
| 8.5% | €77 | €81 | €85 | €90 | €96 |
| 9.5% | €67 | €69 | €72 | €75 | €79 |
| 10.0% | €62 | €64 | €67 | €70 | €73 |

| 10.5% | €58 | €60 | €62 | €65 | €67 |

### Revenue Growth × WACC (Value / Share)

| Growth \ WACC | 7.0% | 7.5% | 8.0% | 8.5% | 9.5% | 10.0% | 10.4% | 10.5% | 11.0% |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

## 8. Reverse DCF — What the Market Implies


Instead of asking *"what is the company worth?"*, we ask *"what must the market be assuming to justify the current price?"* Each parameter is solved independently while holding all others at base-case values.

| Parameter | Implied Value | Our Assumption | Plausible? |
|-----------|-------------:|---------------:|:----------:|
| Revenue growth (p.a.) | 18.1% | 6% | ◐ |
| Operating margin | 26.8% | 14% | ✓ |
| WACC | 5.79% | 10.37% | ⚠ |
| Terminal growth | 8.54% | 3.0% | ⚠ |

**Interpretation:** To justify ~€183/share through growth alone, the company would need to compound revenue at **18.1%** annually for 10 years, reaching **€3782B** by FY2035. No single assumption justifies the price — the market is pricing in multiple favourable outcomes simultaneously.

## 9. Key Risks & Catalysts

For specific details on risks and growth drivers, please refer to the calibration notes in the configuration file or the company's latest 10-K filing.

### General Upside Catalysts
- **Better-than-expected macro environment:** Global economic growth supporting end-market demand.
- **Margin expansion:** Successful execution of cost-saving initiatives or mix shift to higher-margin software/services.
- **New product success:** Faster adoption of new product lines or technologies (e.g., AI).

### General Downside Risks
- **Macroeconomic slowdown:** Recession risk impacting consumer/enterprise spending.
- **Regulatory headwinds:** Antitrust scrutiny or geopolitical trade restrictions.
- **Execution risk:** Failure to meet product roadmaps or margin targets.
- **Valuation compression:** Multiple contraction if interest rates rise or growth slows.

## 10. Methodology & Data Sources

### Approach

This report uses a **two-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model:

1. **Explicit period (10 years):** Revenue is projected using near-term company guidance and consensus estimates, fading to long-term secular growth. Operating margins fade linearly from current levels to long-run targets over 5 years.
2. **Terminal value:** Beyond year 10, FCFF grows at a perpetual rate (g∞ = 2.5%) and is capitalised using the Gordon Growth formula.

The model is supplemented with:
- **Sensitivity analysis** (two-way tables for WACC × growth, growth × margins)
- **Tornado charts** ranking parameter importance
- **Reverse DCF** solving for market-implied expectations

### Data Sources

| Source | Data | Update Frequency |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| SEC EDGAR (XBRL API) | 10 years of annual financials | Annual (20-F/10-K filings) |
| Yahoo Finance | Market cap, beta, price history | Real-time |
| Company Guidance | Revenue & margin targets | Ad hoc |
| Analyst consensus | Near-term revenue estimates | Quarterly |
| Damodaran | Equity risk premium, country risk | Annual |

### Limitations

- Financial data is based on reported XBRL tags, which may differ slightly from manually adjusted figures
- The model uses a constant WACC, which may overstate the discount for a company with minimal leverage
- Near-term growth estimates reflect consensus as of the report date and may change with updated guidance
- Market cap uses the NYSE ADR price converted to EUR at a fixed rate
