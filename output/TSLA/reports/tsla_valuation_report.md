## 3. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

ROIC is the central metric for assessing whether ASML creates value — it measures how much operating profit the company generates per euro of capital invested.

| FY | NOPAT (€B) | Invested Capital (€B) | ROIC | ROE |
|---:|-----------:|----------------------:|-----:|----:|
| 2016 | -0.6 | 17.4 | nan% | nan% |
| 2017 | -1.5 | 22.9 | -8.4% | -41.3% |
| 2018 | -0.3 | 22.6 | -1.5% | -23.0% |
| 2019 | -0.1 | 24.3 | -0.3% | -17.5% |
| 2020 | 1.8 | 26.7 | 7.4% | 10.9% |
| 2021 | 5.9 | 34.5 | 22.0% | 24.8% |
| 2022 | 12.3 | 50.8 | 35.6% | 41.6% |
| 2023 | 8.0 | 75.8 | 15.7% | 33.5% |
| 2024 | 6.4 | 93.5 | 8.4% | 11.3% |
| 2025 | 3.9 | 107.9 | 4.2% | 5.2% |

**3-year average ROIC: 9.4%** — well above the cost of capital (WACC ≈ 8.5%), confirming ASML's exceptional value creation.

## 4. Working Capital & Cash Conversion

| FY | NWC (€B) | ΔNWC (€B) | DSO | DIO | DPO | CCC (days) |
|---:|---------:|-----------:|----:|----:|----:|-----------:|
| 2021 | -2.4 | -2.3 | 13 | 52 | 91 | -26 |
| 2022 | 0.5 | +2.9 | 13 | 77 | 92 | -1 |
| 2023 | 2.7 | +2.2 | 13 | 63 | 67 | 10 |
| 2024 | 4.0 | +1.3 | 17 | 55 | 57 | 14 |
| 2025 | 3.6 | -0.4 | 18 | 58 | 63 | 13 |

**Key observation:** ASML's cash conversion cycle is **13 days**, reflecting the 6–12 month build times for EUV systems. Days inventory outstanding (58 days) is particularly high, which is structural for capital equipment manufacturers.

## 5. Cost of Capital (WACC)

### CAPM Inputs

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|------:|--------|
| Risk-free rate (Rf) | 4.5% | 10y German Bund |
| Equity beta (β) | 1.74 | Analyst estimate (< Yahoo's 1.46) |
| Equity risk premium | 5.0% | Damodaran mature market |
| Country risk premium | 0.0% | Netherlands (AAA) |

### Capital Structure (Market Values)

| Component | Value | Weight |
|-----------|------:|-------:|
| Equity (market cap) | €1441B | 99.5% |
| Debt (book value) | €6.6B | 0.5% |

### Result

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Cost of equity (Rₑ) | 13.20% |
| Cost of debt (after-tax) | 4.50% |
| **WACC** | **13.16%** |

*Note: ASML uses minimal financial leverage (D/V < 1%), so WACC is dominated by the cost of equity. The beta of 1.10 is a conservative estimate — Yahoo Finance reports 1.46, which would raise WACC to ~10%.*

## 7. Sensitivity Analysis

### Value Driver Ranking (Tornado)

Which parameters have the biggest impact on intrinsic value?

| Rank | Parameter | Range | Low | High | Swing |
|-----:|-----------|------:|----:|-----:|------:|
| 1 | operating_margin | 28% → 42% | €52 | €86 | €34 |
| 2 | wacc_rate | 7% → 11% | €37 | €18 | €19 |
| 3 | capex_to_revenue | 4% → 10% | €42 | €23 | €19 |
| 4 | growth_rate | 3% → 18% | €12 | €28 | €16 |
| 5 | tax_rate | 10% → 20% | €14 | €10 | €3 |
| 6 | nwc_to_revenue | 10% → 20% | €13 | €11 | €2 |
| 7 | terminal_growth | 2% → 4% | €13 | €14 | €1 |

**Key insight:** Revenue growth is by far the most impactful parameter, with a swing of **€34** between bear and bull cases. WACC ranks second, followed by operating margins.

### WACC × Terminal Growth (Value / Share)

| WACC \ g∞ | 1.5% | 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% | 3.5% |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 7.0% | €29 | €31 | €34 | €37 | €41 |
| 7.5% | €27 | €28 | €30 | €33 | €36 |
| 8.0% | €25 | €26 | €27 | €29 | €32 |
| 8.5% | €23 | €24 | €25 | €26 | €28 |
| 9.5% | €20 | €20 | €21 | €22 | €23 |
| 10.0% | €18 | €19 | €20 | €20 | €21 |
| 10.5% | €17 | €18 | €18 | €19 | €20 |
| 11.0% | €16 | €17 | €17 | €18 | €18 |
| 13.2% | €13 | €13 | €13 | €14 | €14 |

### Revenue Growth × WACC (Value / Share)

| Growth \ WACC | 7.0% | 7.5% | 8.0% | 8.5% | 9.5% | 10.0% | 10.5% | 11.0% | 13.2% |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4% | €32 | €28 | €25 | €23 | €19 | €18 | €17 | €16 | €12 |
| 6% | €37 | €33 | €29 | €26 | €22 | €20 | €19 | €18 | €14 |
| 8% | €43 | €38 | €34 | €30 | €25 | €23 | €22 | €20 | €15 |
| 10% | €49 | €43 | €39 | €35 | €29 | €26 | €24 | €23 | €17 |
| 12% | €57 | €50 | €44 | €40 | €33 | €30 | €28 | €26 | €19 |
| 14% | €65 | €57 | €51 | €45 | €37 | €34 | €32 | €29 | €22 |

## 8. Reverse DCF — What the Market Implies

Instead of asking *"what is ASML worth?"*, we ask *"what must the market be assuming to justify the current price?"* Each parameter is solved independently while holding all others at base-case values.

| Parameter | Implied Value | Our Assumption | Plausible? |
|-----------|-------------:|---------------:|:----------:|
| Revenue growth (p.a.) | 40.0% | 6% | ⚠ |
| Operating margin | 70.0% | 12% | ⚠ |
| WACC | 3.41% | 13.16% | ⚠ |
| Terminal growth | 12.66% | 3.0% | ⚠ |

**Interpretation:** To justify ~€384/share through growth alone, ASML would need to compound revenue at **40.0%** annually for 10 years, reaching **€2743B** by FY2035. This would make ASML larger than the entire WFE market today. No single assumption justifies the price — the market is pricing in multiple favourable outcomes simultaneously.

## 9. Key Risks & Catalysts

### Upside Catalysts

- **High-NA EUV ramp:** Successful volume deployment of next-gen systems (€350M+ ASP vs ~€200M for standard EUV) could accelerate revenue and margins
- **AI capex supercycle:** Sustained hyperscaler investment in AI chips drives leading-edge node demand beyond current consensus
- **Installed base growth:** Service & upgrade revenue (~30% of total) grows predictably as the EUV fleet expands
- **Geopolitical reshoring:** CHIPS Act and EU subsidies drive incremental fab construction, expanding the addressable market

### Downside Risks

- **Cyclical downturn:** Semiconductor capex is highly cyclical; a 30–40% peak-to-trough revenue decline is historically normal
- **China export restrictions:** Further tightening could remove ~15% of addressable market (DUV sales to China)
- **Customer concentration:** Top 3 customers (TSMC, Samsung, Intel) represent ~80%+ of system revenue
- **Execution risk on High-NA:** Delays or yield issues could push out the growth inflection point
- **Valuation compression:** Multiple contraction if growth expectations are not met or interest rates remain elevated

## 10. Methodology & Data Sources

### Approach

This report uses a **two-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model:

1. **Explicit period (10 years):** Revenue is projected using near-term company guidance and consensus estimates, fading to long-term secular growth. Operating margins fade linearly from current levels to long-run targets over 5 years.
2. **Terminal value:** Beyond year 10, FCFF grows at a perpetual rate (g∞ = 2.5%) and is capitalised using the Gordon Growth formula.

The model is supplemented with:
- **Sensitivity analysis** (two-way tables for WACC × growth, growth × margins)
- **Tornado charts** ranking parameter importance
- **Reverse DCF** solving for market-implied expectations

### Data Sources

| Source | Data | Update Frequency |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| SEC EDGAR (XBRL API) | 10 years of annual financials | Annual (20-F filings) |
| Yahoo Finance | Market cap, beta, price history | Real-time |
| ASML Investor Day (Nov 2024) | 2030 revenue & margin targets | Ad hoc |
| Analyst consensus | Near-term revenue estimates | Quarterly |
| Damodaran | Equity risk premium, country risk | Annual |

### Limitations

- Financial data is based on reported XBRL tags, which may differ slightly from manually adjusted figures
- The model uses a constant WACC, which may overstate the discount for a company with minimal leverage
- Near-term growth estimates reflect consensus as of the report date and may change with updated guidance
- Market cap uses the NYSE ADR price converted to EUR at a fixed rate
