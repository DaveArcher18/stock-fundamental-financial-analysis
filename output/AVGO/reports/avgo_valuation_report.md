## 3. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

ROIC is the central metric for assessing whether ASML creates value — it measures how much operating profit the company generates per euro of capital invested.

| FY | NOPAT (€B) | Invested Capital (€B) | ROIC | ROE |
|---:|-----------:|----------------------:|-----:|----:|
| 2016 | -0.4 | nan | nan% | nan% |
| 2017 | 2.1 | 42.1 | nan% | 7.7% |
| 2018 | 4.6 | 45.0 | 11.0% | 60.4% |
| 2019 | 3.1 | 61.6 | 6.9% | nan% |
| 2020 | 3.6 | 67.5 | 5.9% | nan% |
| 2021 | 7.7 | 62.3 | 11.4% | nan% |
| 2022 | 12.8 | 59.8 | 20.5% | 46.0% |
| 2023 | 14.6 | 57.5 | 24.4% | 62.0% |
| 2024 | 12.1 | 154.6 | 21.1% | 24.6% |
| 2025 | 22.9 | 153.4 | 14.8% | nan% |

**3-year average ROIC: 20.1%** — well above the cost of capital (WACC ≈ 8.5%), confirming ASML's exceptional value creation.

## 4. Working Capital & Cash Conversion

| FY | NWC (€B) | ΔNWC (€B) | DSO | DIO | DPO | CCC (days) |
|---:|---------:|-----------:|----:|----:|----:|-----------:|
| 2021 | 2.3 | -0.2 | 28 | 45 | 37 | 35 |
| 2022 | 3.9 | +1.6 | 33 | 63 | 33 | 63 |
| 2023 | 3.8 | -0.0 | 32 | 62 | 40 | 55 |
| 2024 | 4.5 | +0.7 | 31 | 34 | 32 | 33 |
| 2025 | 7.9 | +3.3 | 41 | 40 | 28 | 53 |

**Key observation:** ASML's cash conversion cycle is **53 days**, reflecting the 6–12 month build times for EUV systems. Days inventory outstanding (40 days) is particularly high, which is structural for capital equipment manufacturers.

## 5. Cost of Capital (WACC)

### CAPM Inputs

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|------:|--------|
| Risk-free rate (Rf) | 4.5% | 10y German Bund |
| Equity beta (β) | 1.21 | Analyst estimate (< Yahoo's 1.46) |
| Equity risk premium | 5.0% | Damodaran mature market |
| Country risk premium | 0.0% | Netherlands (AAA) |

### Capital Structure (Market Values)

| Component | Value | Weight |
|-----------|------:|-------:|
| Equity (market cap) | €1418B | 100.0% |
| Debt (book value) | €0.0B | 0.0% |

### Result

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Cost of equity (Rₑ) | 10.55% |
| Cost of debt (after-tax) | nan% |
| **WACC** | **nan%** |

*Note: ASML uses minimal financial leverage (D/V < 1%), so WACC is dominated by the cost of equity. The beta of 1.10 is a conservative estimate — Yahoo Finance reports 1.46, which would raise WACC to ~10%.*

**Key insight:** Revenue growth is by far the most impactful parameter, with a swing of **€117** between bear and bull cases. WACC ranks second, followed by operating margins.

### WACC × Terminal Growth (Value / Share)

| WACC \ g∞ | 1.5% | 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% | 3.5% |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

| 11.0% | €102 | €105 | €108 | €112 | €116 |

### Revenue Growth × WACC (Value / Share)

| Growth \ WACC | 7.0% | 7.5% | 8.0% | 8.5% | 9.5% | 10.0% | 10.5% | 11.0% |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

## 8. Reverse DCF — What the Market Implies

Instead of asking *"what is ASML worth?"*, we ask *"what must the market be assuming to justify the current price?"* Each parameter is solved independently while holding all others at base-case values.

| Parameter | Implied Value | Our Assumption | Plausible? |
|-----------|-------------:|---------------:|:----------:|
| Revenue growth (p.a.) | 0.0% | 6% | ✓ |
| Operating margin | 10.0% | 45% | ✓ |
| WACC | 6.07% | nan% | ✓ |
| Terminal growth | nan% | 3.0% | ✓ |

**Interpretation:** To justify ~€299/share through growth alone, ASML would need to compound revenue at **0.0%** annually for 10 years, reaching **€64B** by FY2035. This would make ASML larger than the entire WFE market today. No single assumption justifies the price — the market is pricing in multiple favourable outcomes simultaneously.

## 9. Key Risks & Catalysts

### Upside Catalysts

- **High-NA EUV ramp:** Successful volume deployment of next-gen systems (€350M+ ASP vs ~€200M for standard EUV) could accelerate revenue and margins
- **AI capex supercycle:** Sustained hyperscaler investment in AI chips drives leading-edge node demand beyond current consensus
- **Installed base growth:** Service & upgrade revenue (~30% of total) grows predictably as the EUV fleet expands
- **Geopolitical reshoring:** CHIPS Act and EU subsidies drive incremental fab construction, expanding the addressable market

### Downside Risks

- **Cyclical downturn:** Semiconductor capex is highly cyclical; a 30–40% peak-to-trough revenue decline is historically normal
- **China export restrictions:** Further tightening could remove ~15% of addressable market (DUV sales to China)
- **Customer concentration:** Top 3 customers (TSMC, Samsung, Intel) represent ~80%+ of system revenue
- **Execution risk on High-NA:** Delays or yield issues could push out the growth inflection point
- **Valuation compression:** Multiple contraction if growth expectations are not met or interest rates remain elevated

## 10. Methodology & Data Sources

### Approach

This report uses a **two-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model:

1. **Explicit period (10 years):** Revenue is projected using near-term company guidance and consensus estimates, fading to long-term secular growth. Operating margins fade linearly from current levels to long-run targets over 5 years.
2. **Terminal value:** Beyond year 10, FCFF grows at a perpetual rate (g∞ = 2.5%) and is capitalised using the Gordon Growth formula.

The model is supplemented with:
- **Sensitivity analysis** (two-way tables for WACC × growth, growth × margins)
- **Tornado charts** ranking parameter importance
- **Reverse DCF** solving for market-implied expectations

### Data Sources

| Source | Data | Update Frequency |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| SEC EDGAR (XBRL API) | 10 years of annual financials | Annual (20-F filings) |
| Yahoo Finance | Market cap, beta, price history | Real-time |
| ASML Investor Day (Nov 2024) | 2030 revenue & margin targets | Ad hoc |
| Analyst consensus | Near-term revenue estimates | Quarterly |
| Damodaran | Equity risk premium, country risk | Annual |

### Limitations

- Financial data is based on reported XBRL tags, which may differ slightly from manually adjusted figures
- The model uses a constant WACC, which may overstate the discount for a company with minimal leverage
- Near-term growth estimates reflect consensus as of the report date and may change with updated guidance
- Market cap uses the NYSE ADR price converted to EUR at a fixed rate
