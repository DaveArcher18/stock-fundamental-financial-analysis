# CALIBRATION NOTES (Feb 2026):
#   • Revenue growth: Based on ASML Investor Day (Nov 2024) guidance of
#     €44–60B by 2030, FY2025 actual of €32.7B, and FY2026 guidance of
#     €34–39B.  Near-term rates reflect consensus + company guidance.
#   • Margins: Operating margin target derived from 2030 gross margin
#     guidance (56–60%) less R&D (~13%) and SG&A (~4%) intensity.
#   • Capital intensity: Calibrated to 3-year actual averages from SEC
#     XBRL data (capex/rev 7.1%, D&A/rev 2.9%).
#   • Tax: Effective rate trending up (16.3% 3y avg → 18.2% in 2024)
#     due to Dutch tax reform and global minimum tax (Pillar Two).
#   • Beta: Using 1.10 (analyst judgement) vs 1.46 (Yahoo Finance).
#     Lower beta reflects ASML's monopoly position and structural demand.

#
# Path to ASML's €52B midpoint target by 2030 (from €28.3B base):

#   FY2026: €36.5B (+11.6%) — midpoint of €34–39B guidance
#   FY2027: €42.0B (+15.1%) — consensus: High-NA EUV ramp + 2nm transition
#   FY2028: €48.0B (+14.3%) — continued AI/advanced node capex
#   FY2029: €52.0B (+8.3%)  — approaching ASML 2030 midpoint target

# --- Margin Assumptions ---
# ASML 2030 gross margin target: 56–60%
# Operating margin = gross margin − R&D (~13%) − SG&A (~4%) ≈ 38–43%
# Using midpoint of 38% as target (conservative — leaves room for scale)
margins:
  gross_margin: 0.56              # 2030 midpoint of 56–60% guidance
  operating_margin: 0.38          # Gross margin − R&D − SG&A
  rd_to_revenue: 0.13            # R&D intensity (stable historically)
  sga_to_revenue: 0.04           # SG&A intensity (slight leverage at scale)

# --- Capital Intensity ---
# Calibrated to 3-year SEC data averages:
#   Capex/Rev: 7.1% (elevated vs historical 5.9% — capacity buildout phase)
#   D&A/Rev:   2.9% (trending up with higher installed asset base)
#   NWC/Rev:   As a *level*, NWC/Rev is ~43%, but for ΔNWC we use the
#              marginal rate (~15–18%) since not all NWC scales linearly.
capital_intensity:
  capex_to_revenue: 0.07          # Elevated phase — capacity buildout for High-NA
  depreciation_to_revenue: 0.03   # Aligns with 3y actual average
  nwc_to_revenue: 0.17            # Marginal NWC/ΔRevenue (not level NWC/Revenue)

# --- Working Capital Days ---
# Calibrated to actual data (ASML has very long build cycles → high DIO)
working_capital_days:
  dso: 58                         # Actual FY2024
  dio: 289                        # ~10 months — EUV systems take 6–12mo to build
